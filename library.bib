As information and communication technologies (ICT) developed and applied in traditional power systems, the improvement of smart grid cyber-physical-systems (CPS) increases too. IoT-based smart grid systems are critical infrastructures, also they have complex architectures and include critical devices. They contain communication systems that can lead to national security deficits, disruption of public order, loss of life or large-scale economic damage when the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the communication is broken down. These huge systems may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Therefore, there is a lot of research effort to enhance smart grid security in industry, government, and academia. The security approaches are important to improve solutions against cyber-attacks in smart grid applications. We present a comprehensive survey supported by a wide review of earlier work. Additionally, recent advances and countermeasures are presented on smart grid cyber-security. In this paper, the threats and potential solutions of the IoT-based smart grid are analyzed. We focus on cyber-attack types and provide an in-depth of the cyber-security state of the smart grid. Particularly, we concentrate on the discussion and examination of network vulnerabilities, attack countermeasures, and security requirements. We aim to supply a deep understanding of cyber-security vulnerabilities and solutions and give a guide on future research directions for cyber-security in smart grid applications.},

The goal of this study is to identify and analyze the common cyber security vulnerabilities. To achieve this goal, a systematic mapping study was conducted, and in total, 78 primary studies were identified and analyzed. After a detailed analysis of the selected studies, we identified the important security vulnerabilities and their frequency of occurrence. Data were also synthesized and analyzed to present the venue of publication, country of publication, key targeted infrastructures and applications. The results show that the security approaches mentioned so far only target security in general, and the solutions provided in these studies need more empirical validation and real implementation. In addition, our results show that most of the selected studies in this review targeted only a few common security vulnerabilities such as phishing, denial-of-service and malware. However, there is a need, in future research, to identify the key cyber security vulnerabilities, targeted/victimized applications, mitigation techniques and infrastructures, so that researchers and practitioners could get a better insight into it.},

   abstract = {The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) significantly impacts our healthcare system because it allows us to track and verify patient medical data before storing it in the cloud for future use. A rapidly expanding platform like IoMT requires high security to keep all data safe. The patient’s prescription history and other sensitive information must be encrypted and managed with great care. Nevertheless, it is challenging to determine what data uses are acceptable while protecting patient privacy and security. Understanding the limits of current technologies and envisioning future research paths is crucial for establishing a safe and reliable data environment. An untrustworthy person can communicate with a trustworthy person via blockchain, a decentralized digital ledger that allows for end-to-end communication. Therefore, this research suggests that the healthcare industry with blockchain-integrated cyber-security based on artificial intelligence (BICS-AI) in medical care to preserve medical-related things. Blockchain applications have the potential to consistently identify the most severe, potentially life-threatening mistakes in the medical field. The use of blockchain for decentralized data protection helps to protect patient health records from compromise. With the help of an access control provider (ACP), here came up with a lightweight solution that addresses this issue by allowing the delegating of security operations. Medical data from IoMT and integrated devices can be collected and stored securely and distributed using a conventional in-depth approach combined with blockchain, making it suitable for healthcare professionals such as nursing homes, hospitals, and the healthcare industry where data exchange is required. The research findings indicate that the suggested system is viable and has a 94.84% security rate, a security performance of 96.4%, a success rate of 89.9%, and a 5.1% latency rate compared to traditional methods.},

Firewalls, antivirus software, and other technological solutions for safeguarding personal data and computer networks are essential but not sufficient to ensure security. As our nation rapidly building its Cyber- Infrastructure, it is equally important that we educate our population to work properly with this infrastructure. Cyber-Ethics, Cyber-Safety, and Cyber-Security issues need to be integrated in the educational process beginning at an early age. Security counter measures help ensure the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of information systems by preventing or mitigating asset losses from Cyber security attacks. Recently cyber security has emerged as an established discipline for computer systems andinfrastructures with a focus on protection of valuable information stored on those systems fromadversaries who want to obtain, corrupt, damage, destroy or prohibit access to it. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a program that analyses what happens or has happened during an execution and tries to find indications that the computer has been misused. A wide range of metaphors was considered, including those relating to: military and other types of conflict, biological, health care, markets, three-dimensional space, and physical asset protection. These in turn led to consideration of a variety of possible approaches for improving cyber security in the future. These approaches were labelled “Heterogeneity” ,“Motivating Secure Behaviour” and “Cyber Wellness” . Cyber Security plays an important role in the development of information technology as well as Internet services. Our attention is usually drawn on “Cyber Security” when we hear about “Cyber Crimes”. Our first thought on “National Cyber Security” therefore starts on how good is our infrastructure for handling “Cyber Crimes”. This paper focus on cyber security emerging trends while adopting new technologies such as mobile computing, cloud computing, e-commerce, and social networking. The paper also describes the challenges due to lack of coordination between Security agencies and the Critical IT Infrastructure.},

This paper proposes a method of automating post-exploitation by combining deep reinforcement learning and the PowerShell Empire, which is famous as a post-exploitation framework. Our reinforcement learning agents select one of the PowerShell Empire modules as an action. The state of the agents is defined by 10 parameters such as type of account that was compromised by the agents. In the learning phase, we compared the learning progress of the 3 reinforcement learning models: A2C, Q-Learning, and SARSA. The result shows that the A2C could gain reward most efficiently. Moreover, the behavior of the trained agents are evaluated in a test domain network. The results show that the trained agent using A2C could obtain the administrative privileges to the domain controller.},

Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as one of the enabling technologies for a smart grid network. As the IoT connected devices continue to grow at a rapid pace, one of the major challenges is security since the devices are online hence making the smart grid vulnerable to significant attacks. Since an IoT based smart grid would consist of potentially millions of nodes, it has the largest attack surface for an IoT focused cyber-attack. A cyber-attack on a smart grid would have devastating effects on reliability of widespread infrastructure given the potential cascade effects of shutting down the electricity grid since most of the devices in our homes, offices, hospitals and trains require electricity to run. Once a single device is compromised, then the whole grid becomes vulnerable to cyberattacks. Such attacks on electricity supply can grind entire cities to a halt thereby causing huge financial and economic losses. This makes security a critical factor to consider before large scale deployment of IoT based smart grid networks. In this paper we review and explore the major challenges and security issues stunting the growth of IoT-based smart grid networks.},

In this paper, we explore the potential of using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) deep learning in detecting IoT malware. Specifically, our approach uses RNN to analyze ARM-based IoT applications’ execution operation codes (OpCodes). To train our models, we use an IoT application dataset comprising 281 malware and 270 benign ware. Then, we evaluate the trained model using 100 new IoT malware samples (i.e. not previously exposed to the model) with three different Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) configurations. Findings of the 10-fold cross validation analysis show that the second configuration with 2-layer neurons has the highest accuracy (98.18%) in the detection of new malware samples. A comparative summary with other machine learning classifiers also demonstrate that the LSTM approach delivers the best possible outcome.},

Consequently, their inherent safety risks and security risks are so intertwined that the conventional analysis approaches which address them separately may be rendered inadequate. STPA (Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis) is a top-down hazard analysis technique that has been incorporated into several recently proposed integrated Safety and Security (S&S) analysis methods. This paper presents a novel methodology that leverages not only STPA, but also custom matrices to ensure a more comprehensive S&S analysis. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using a case study of particular commercial cloud-based monitoring and control system for residential energy storage systems.},

   abstract = {By the emergence of the fourth industrial revolution, interconnected devices and sensors generate large-scale, dynamic, and inharmonious data in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platforms. Such vast heterogeneous data increase the challenges of security risks and data analysis procedures. As IIoT grows, cyber-attacks become more diverse and complex, making existing anomaly detection models less effective to operate. In this paper, an ensemble deep learning model that uses the benefits of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and the Auto-Encoder (AE) architecture to identify out-of-norm activities for cyber threat hunting in IIoT is proposed. In this model, the LSTM is applied to create a model on normal time series of data (past and present data) to learn normal data patterns and the important features of data are identified by AE to reduce data dimension. In addition, the imbalanced nature of IIoT datasets has not been considered in most of the previous literature, affecting low accuracy and performance. To solve this problem, the proposed model extracts new balanced data from the imbalanced datasets, and these new balanced data are fed into the deep LSTM AE anomaly detection model. In this paper, the proposed model is evaluated on two real IIoT datasets -Gas Pipeline (GP) and Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) that are imbalanced and consist of long-term and short-term dependency on data. The results are compared with conventional machine learning classifiers, Random Forest (RF), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Decision Tree (DT), and Super Vector Machines (SVM), in which higher performance in terms of accuracy is obtained, 99.3% and 99.7% based on GP and SWaT datasets, respectively. Moreover, the proposed ensemble model is compared with advanced related models, including Stacked Auto-Encoders (SAE), Naive Bayes (NB), Projective Adaptive Resonance Theory (PART), Convolutional Auto-Encoder (C-AE), and Package Signatures (PS) based LSTM (PS-LSTM) model.},

   abstract = {Since the last decade, cloud-based electronic health records (EHRs) have gained significant attention to enable remote patient monitoring. The recent development of Healthcare 4.0 using the Internet of Things (IoT) components and cloud computing to access medical operations remotely has gained the researcher's attention from a smart city perspective. Healthcare 4.0 mainly consisted of periodic medical data sensing, aggregation, data transmission, data sharing, and data storage. The sensitive and personal data of patients lead to several challenges while protecting it from hackers. Therefore storing, accessing, and sharing the patient medical information on the cloud needs security attention that data should not be compromised by the authorized user's components of E-healthcare systems. To achieve secure medical data storage, sharing, and accessing in cloud service provider, several cryptography algorithms are designed so far. However, such conventional solutions failed to achieve the trade-off between the requirements of EHR security solutions such as computational efficiency, service side verification, user side verifications, without the trusted third party, and strong security. Blockchain-based security solutions gained significant attention in the recent past due to the ability to provide strong security for data storage and sharing with the minimum computation efforts. The blockchain made focused on bitcoin technology among the researchers. Utilizing the blockchain which secure healthcare records management has been of recent interest. This paper presents the systematic study of modern blockchain-based solutions for securing medical data with or without cloud computing. We implement and evaluate the different methods using blockchain in this paper. According to the research studies, the research gaps, challenges, and future roadmap are the outcomes of this paper that boost emerging Healthcare 4.0 technology.},

   abstract = {The primary objective of the current study is to analytically examine the economic benefits an organization can obtain by receiving and processing cyber threat intelligence (CTI) shared by the US government. Our results show that the benefits from receiving CTI are closely associated with the difference between the threat level indicated by the CTI and the receiving organization’s prior belief of the threat level. In addition, for the same difference between the threat levels indicated by the CTI and the organization’s prior belief, our analyses show that the magnitude of adjustments to an organization’s cybersecurity investments is inversely related to the organization’s prior belief of the threat level. Thus, larger benefits can be obtained when the receiving organization’s prior belief of a threat level is lower. Taken together, our results suggest that the common belief that it is optimal for a federal government agency or department to focus on sharing CTI related to vulnerabilities with the highest threat level is misguided. More generally, the benefits from CTI sharing can be improved if producers of CTI could develop a clearer understanding of the prior beliefs that organizations have concerning their threat level and focus on sharing CTI that is significantly different from those prior beliefs.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Researchers and practitioners rely on literature reviews to synthesize large bodies of knowledge. Many types of literature reviews have been developed, each targeting a specific purpose. However, these syntheses are hampered if the review type’s paradigmatic roots, methods, and markers of rigor are only vaguely understood. One literature review type whose methodology has yet to be elucidated is the state-of-the-art (SotA) review. If medical educators are to harness SotA reviews to generate knowledge syntheses, we must understand and articulate the paradigmatic roots of, and methods for, conducting SotA reviews. Methods: We reviewed 940 articles published between 2014–2021 labeled as SotA reviews. We (a) identified all SotA methods-related resources, (b) examined the foundational principles and techniques underpinning the reviews, and (c) combined our findings to inductively analyze and articulate the philosophical foundations, process steps, and markers of rigor. Results: In the 940 articles reviewed, nearly all manuscripts (98%) lacked citations for how to conduct a SotA review. The term “state of the art” was used in 4 different ways. Analysis revealed that SotA articles are grounded in relativism and subjectivism. Discussion: This article provides a 6-step approach for conducting SotA reviews. SotA reviews offer an interpretive synthesis that describes: This is where we are now. This is how we got here. This is where we could be going. This chronologically rooted narrative synthesis provides a methodology for reviewing large bodies of literature to explore why and how our current knowledge has developed and to offer new research directions.},

This paper aims to investigate the emerging threat of AI-powered cyberattacks and provide insights into malicious used of AI in cyberattacks. The study was performed through a three-step process by selecting only articles based on quality, exclusion, and inclusion criteria that focus on AI-driven cyberattacks. Searches in ACM, arXiv Blackhat, Scopus, Springer, MDPI, IEEE Xplore and other sources were executed to retrieve relevant articles. Out of the 936 papers that met our search criteria, a total of 46 articles were finally selected for this study. The result shows that 56% of the AI-Driven cyberattack technique identified was demonstrated in the access and penetration phase, 12% was demonstrated in exploitation, and command and control phase, respectively; 11% was demonstrated in the reconnaissance phase; 9% was demonstrated in the delivery phase of the cybersecurity kill chain. The findings in this study shows that existing cyber defence infrastructures will become inadequate to address the increasing speed, and complex decision logic of AI-driven attacks.

   abstract = {Botnets are large networks of bots (compromised machines) that are under the control of a small number of bot masters. They pose a significant threat to Internet's communications and applications. A botnet relies on command and control (C2) communications channels traffic between its members for its attack execution. C2 traffic occurs prior to any attack; hence, the detection of botnet's C2 traffic enables the detection of members of the botnet before any real harm happens. We analyze C2 traffic and find that it exhibits a periodic behavior. This is due to the pre-programmed behavior of bots that check for updates to download them every T seconds. We exploit this periodic behavior to detect C2 traffic. The detection involves evaluating the periodogram of the monitored traffic. Then applying Walker's large sample test to the periodogram's maximum ordinate in order to determine if it is due to a periodic component or not. If the periodogram of the monitored traffic contains a periodic component, then it is highly likely that it is due to a bot's C2 traffic. The test looks only at aggregate control plane traffic behavior, which makes it more scalable than techniques that involve deep packet inspection (DPI) or tracking the communication flows of different hosts. We apply the test to two types of botnet, tinyP2P and IRC that are generated by SLINGbot. We verify the periodic behavior of their C2 traffic and compare it to the results we get on real traffic that is obtained from a secured enterprise network. We further study the characteristics of the test in the presence of injected HTTP background traffic and the effect of the duty cycle on the periodic behavior. © 2013.},

While malware execution in a sandboxed environment may provide insightful feedback about what the malware does in a machine, anti-virtualisation and hooking evasion methods may allow malware to bypass such detection methods. The main objective of this work is to complement sandbox execution with the use of binary emulation frameworks. The core idea is to exploit the fact that binary emulation frameworks may test samples quicker than a sandbox environment as they do not need to open a whole new virtual machine to execute the binary. While with this approach we lose the granularity of the data collected through a sandbox, one may only need to efficiently determine whether a file is malicious or to which malware family it belongs. To this end, we record the performed API calls and use them to explore the efficacy of using them as features for binary and multiclass classification. Our extensive experiments with real-world malware illustrate that this approach is very accurate, achieving state-of-the art outcomes with a statistically robust set of classification experiments while simultaneously having a relatively low computational overhead compared to traditional sandbox approaches. In fact, we compare the binary analysis results with a commercial sandbox, and our classification outperforms it at the expense of the fine-grained results that a sandbox provides.},

   abstract = {Blockchain technology has emerged as a compelling field of study over the past decade. Nevertheless, certain blockchain-based protocols, particularly those reliant on permissioned blockchains, continue to be under the governance of a central authority (CA). This central authority possesses extensive control capabilities, including the facilitation of user network access, as well as the establishment, connection, and revocation of users to and from the network. Consequently, the majority of policies within these protocols are centrally administered by a singular party. This paper introduces an architectural framework and a specific protocol denoted as the “Anonymous Reporting System with No Central Authority” (ARSnCA) on a public blockchain infrastructure. This design aims to mitigate the challenges posed by untrusted privileged insiders to the ARSnCA. It is hypothesized that this approach can enhance system reliability, fault tolerance, and foster trust among network members. To eliminate the central authority, a concept termed the virtual blockchain (VBC) is implemented as an embedded permissioned blockchain within a permissionless blockchain. Following the removal of the CA, the authorities previously held by the central authority are transferred to the members of the VBC. Comparative analysis and evaluation of the ARSnCA protocol demonstrate a performance advantage, with speeds that are 62% and 92% faster than reporting protocols based on ring signatures and other protocols included in the comparison.},

While Industry 4.0 envisions the integration of various technologies to achieve seamless operations in industries, the unique characteristics of defense manufacturing, such as stringent data limitations and security requirements, make direct translation challenging. Through a comprehensive review of academic literature, key themes were identified, including quality control, digitalization, cyber–physical aspects, sustainability, risk management, ownership of information, and security. Drawing from the reviewed publications, potential solutions were distilled into related approaches, such as data governance frameworks, data exchange standards, blockchain, additive manufacturing, transparent digital supply chains, and smart factories. These solutions present opportunities for the Australian defense manufacturing industry to overcome the identified challenges and leverage the benefits of Industry 4.0, including improved quality control, increased efficiency, enhanced security, and optimized supply chains. By embracing these opportunities, the defense manufacturing sector can successfully navigate the complexities of Industry 4.0 and realize its vision of seamless integration for continued growth and success.},

This paper navigates the intricate landscape of post-quantum cryptographic approaches and emerging threats specific to the healthcare sector. Delving into encryption protocols such as lattice-based, code-based, hash-based, and multivariate polynomial cryptography, the paper addresses challenges in adoption and compatibility within healthcare systems. The exploration of potential threats posed by quantum attacks and vulnerabilities in existing encryption standards underscores the urgency of a change in basic assumptions in healthcare data security. The paper provides a detailed roadmap for implementing post-quantum cybersecurity solutions, considering the unique challenges faced by healthcare organizations, including integration issues, budget constraints, and the need for specialized training. Finally, the abstract concludes with an emphasis on the importance of timely adoption of post-quantum strategies to ensure the resilience of healthcare data in the face of evolving threats. This roadmap not only offers practical insights into securing medical data but also serves as a guide for future directions in the dynamic landscape of post-quantum healthcare cybersecurity.},

It involves creating or altering video, audio, or images to make them appear as though they depict something or someone else. Deepfake technology advances just like the mechanisms that are used to detect them. There's an ongoing cat-and-mouse game between creators of deepfakes and those developing detection methods. As the technology that underpins deepfakes continues to improve, we are obligated to confront the repercussions that it will have on society. The introduction of educational initiatives, regulatory frameworks, technical solutions, and ethical concerns are all potential avenues via which this matter can be addressed. Multiple approaches need to be combined to identify deepfakes effectively. Detecting deepfakes can be challenging due to their increasingly sophisticated nature, but several methods and techniques are being developed to identify them. Mitigating the negative impact of deepfakes involves a combination of technological advancements, awareness, and policy measures. In this paper, we propose a secure deepfake mitigation framework. We have also provided a security analysis of the proposed framework via the Scyhter tool-based formal security verification. It proves that the proposed framework is secure against various cyber attacks. We also discuss the societal impact of deepfake events along with its detection process. Then some AI models, which are used for creating and detecting the deepfake events, are highlighted. Ultimately, we provide the practical implementation of the proposed framework to observe its functioning in a real-world scenario.},

Algorithms used for the encryption of plain text are not suitable for multimedia encryption. This paper proposes a new and unique algorithm - Rubik's cube scrambling with Bitplane shuffling and Frame rotation (RBF) for the encryption of coloured images. RBF is a symmetric key algorithm that takes two 128-bit key inputs from the user. The algorithm uses Rubik's cube moves for generating scrambling sequences, followed by the shuffling of the bitplanes to generate the encrypted image. A distinctive frame rotation technique is applied to each of the bitplanes in the encryption process. The RBF algorithm is simple and straightforward to implement but produces satisfactory results. The algorithm is evaluated using a range of multimedia data. The paper also describes the various analysis tests and results of the algorithm in detail. Overall, the algorithm demonstrates its value for encrypting many types of multimedia data with practical applications.},

As verification tools reach conclusions, the applicability of their results still requires expert scrutiny. We propose a code generation approach to automatically build both an abstract specification and a concrete implementation of a Dolev-Yao intruder from an abstract attack trace, bridging the gap between theoretical attacks discovered by formal means and practical ones. Through our case studies, we focus on attack traces from the OFMC model checker, Alice&Bob specifications and Java implementations. We introduce a proof-of-concept workflow for concrete attack validation that allows to conveniently integrate, in a user-friendly way, formal methods results into a Model-Driven Development process and at the same time automatically generate a program that allows to demonstrate the attack in practice. In fact, in this contribution, we produce high-level and concrete attack narrations that are both human and machine readable.},

They are a potential target for malware and spyware injections due to their powerful position. Malware is capable of circumventing authentication mechanisms in order to get access to social networking services, which may result in stealing the personal information of users. To deflect any type of attack from malicious software, BrightPass [22], a malware-resistant method based on screen brightness, was introduced. Conversely, we have demonstrated that the BrightPass user's personally identifiable information, such as PIN numbers, may be recovered by evaluating the variations between the recorded input from many authentication sessions. We have then offered various enhanced BrightPass versions to address the observed vulnerability. Our enhanced BrightPass versions are both simple and secure to use when it comes to accessing social networks via mobiles.},

   abstract = {In the field of data concealing, edge detection techniques are frequently employed, particularly for improving image quality and data security. These methods, however, have a lower embedding capacity. In order to take advantage of more edge pixels, many strategies are used nowadays. These schemes either combine the output from multiple edge detectors or enlarge the edges of an edge image by dilating. Even so, if the amount of data is vast, the techniques might not be able to conceal all of it. Therefore, a novel strategy for edge exploitation is still needed to regulate the effectiveness of edge detection-based data-hiding strategies. By using edge detectors in the prediction error space, we utilized more edge pixels in this study (PES). Applying a predictor on the cover image and then calculating the prediction errors, we prepared the PES. The edges in PES were then marked using the edge detector. The edge-error corresponding pixels received more information than the relevant pixels that did not create an edge-error. Additionally, we combined the results from different edge detectors to produce more edges, which does help to achieve a higher embedding capacity. We implanted x number of secret bits in edge pixels and y number of bits in non-edge pixels where x>y. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms its rivals on all performance-measuring criteria, including payload, stego image quality, and resistance to attack.},

Traditional DSSE with forward update privacy and backward security can resist file injection attack and statistical inference attack. However, it is high cost and not suitable for smart devices due to large local storage and low storage capacity. To achieve forward update privacy, we design a novel index structure called RC-II (Inverted Index with Retrieve Control) for search control which improves the security of DSSE. Besides, we combine on and off-chain to decrease client's local storage to a constant. Specifically, we transfer a significant amount of local overhead to the service peers off blockchain. We solve the trust problem between the client and the service by putting authentication data on blockchain. Compared with the state-of-the-art schemes, our scheme has a constant client storage overhead and an excellent retrieval performance which provides guarantee for smart devices under IOT environment.},

The period from 2012 to 2024 was considered and the final collection of 96 studies was taken into account. Our findings were summarised in two stages, a quantitative analysis and a qualitative synthesis. In the first part, various quantitative indicators were used to analyse the evolution of the information and cyber security maturity assessment domain over the last twelve years. The qualitative synthesis, which was limited to 36 research papers, categorises the studies into three key areas: the development of new maturity models, the implementation of established models and frameworks, and the advancement of methodologies to support maturity assessments. The findings reveal significant progress in sector-specific customisation, the growing importance of lightweight models for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and the integration of emerging technologies. This study provides important insights into the evolving landscape of information and cyber security maturity assessment and provides actionable recommendations for academia and industry to improve security resilience and support the adoption of tailored, effective maturity models.},

   abstract = {Similarity graph learning is the most key technique for multiview spectral clustering. However, existing methods fail when applied to uncertain data contaminated with various types of noise in an open environment. Due to the damaged structure by noise, unreliable similar relationships are learned, which extends similarity inconsistency among views. Moreover, the high-order correlation hidden in graphs are ignored generally. To address these problems, we propose a reliable similarity learning scheme for mul-tiview clustering on uncertain data. This method can significantly improve spectral clustering performance in a noisy environment, and the contributions of our scheme include the following three aspects: 1) Uncertain data subspace reconstruction and adaptive graph learning are combined to construct a view-specific graph from high-quality recovered data, thus improving robustness. 2) A low-rank tensor constraint is utilized to facilitate multiview fusion, where the latent high-order correlation among view graphs will be fully explored when learning the consensus graph structure. 3) Data recovery, view-specific graphs, and latent consensus tensor structure are assembled into a unified framework, to be optimized jointly for mutual benefit. Our study also develops an efficient algorithm for obtaining overall solutions. The experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach shows significant improvements in robustness and evaluation metrics over the comparison methods. Manuscript},

   abstract = {'Deepfakes' are computationally created entities that falsely represent reality. They can take image, video, and audio modalities, and pose a threat to many areas of systems and societies, comprising a topic of interest to various aspects of cybersecurity and cybersafety. In 2020, a workshop consulting AI experts from academia, policing, government, the private sector, and state security agencies rank ed deepfak es as the most serious AI threat. These experts noted that since fake material can propagate through many uncontrolled routes, changes in citizen behaviour may be the only effective defence. This study aims to assess human ability to identify image deepfakes of human faces (these being uncurated output from the StyleGAN2 algorithm as trained on the FFHQ dataset) from a pool of non-deepfake images (these being random selection of images from the FFHQ dataset), and to assess the effectiveness of some simple interventions intended to improve detection accuracy. Using an online survey, participants (N = 280) were randomly allocated to one of four groups: a control group, and three assistance interventions. Each participant was shown a sequence of 20 images randomly selected from a pool of 50 deepfake images of human faces and 50 images of real human faces. Participants were asked whether each image was AI-generated or not, to report their confidence, and to describe the reasoning behind each response. Overall detection accuracy was only just above chance and none of the interventions significantly improved this. Of equal concern was the fact that participants' confidence in their answers was high and unrelated to accuracy. Assessing the results on a per-image basis reveals that participants consistently found certain images easy to label correctly and certain images difficult, but reported similarly high confidence regardless of the image. Thus, although participant accuracy was 62% overall, this accuracy across images ranged quite evenly between 85 and 30%, with an accuracy of below 50% for one in every five images. We interpret the findings as suggesting that there is a need for an urgent call to action to address this threat.},

   abstract = {Manufacturing industry profoundly impact economic and societal progress. As being a commonly accepted term for research centers and universities, the Industry 4.0 initiative has received a splendid attention of the business and research community. Although the idea is not new and was on the agenda of academic research in many years with different perceptions, the term “Industry 4.0” is just launched and well accepted to some extend not only in academic life but also in the industrial society as well. While academic research focuses on understanding and defining the concept and trying to develop related systems, business models and respective methodologies, industry, on the other hand, focuses its attention on the change of industrial machine suits and intelligent products as well as potential customers on this progress. It is therefore important for the companies to primarily understand the features and content of the Industry 4.0 for potential transformation from machine dominant manufacturing to digital manufacturing. In order to achieve a successful transformation, they should clearly review their positions and respective potentials against basic requirements set forward for Industry 4.0 standard. This will allow them to generate a well-defined road map. There has been several approaches and discussions going on along this line, a several road maps are already proposed. Some of those are reviewed in this paper. However, the literature clearly indicates the lack of respective assessment methodologies. Since the implementation and applications of related theorems and definitions outlined for the 4th industrial revolution is not mature enough for most of the reel life implementations, a systematic approach for making respective assessments and evaluations seems to be urgently required for those who are intending to speed this transformation up. It is now main responsibility of the research community to developed technological infrastructure with physical systems, management models, business models as well as some well-defined Industry 4.0 scenarios in order to make the life for the practitioners easy. It is estimated by the experts that the Industry 4.0 and related progress along this line will have an enormous effect on social life. As outlined in the introduction, some social transformation is also expected. It is assumed that the robots will be more dominant in manufacturing, implanted technologies, cooperating and coordinating machines, self-decision-making systems, autonom problem solvers, learning machines, 3D printing etc. will dominate the production process. Wearable internet, big data analysis, sensor based life, smart city implementations or similar applications will be the main concern of the community. This social transformation will naturally trigger the manufacturing society to improve their manufacturing suits to cope with the customer requirements and sustain competitive advantage. A summary of the potential progress along this line is reviewed in introduction of the paper. It is so obvious that the future manufacturing systems will have a different vision composed of products, intelligence, communications and information network. This will bring about new business models to be dominant in industrial life. Another important issue to take into account is that the time span of this so-called revolution will be so short triggering a continues transformation process to yield some new industrial areas to emerge. This clearly puts a big pressure on manufacturers to learn, understand, design and implement the transformation process. Since the main motivation for finding the best way to follow this transformation, a comprehensive literature review will generate a remarkable support. This paper presents such a review for highlighting the progress and aims to help improve the awareness on the best experiences. It is intended to provide a clear idea for those wishing to generate a road map for digitizing the respective manufacturing suits. By presenting this review it is also intended to provide a hands-on library of Industry 4.0 to both academics as well as industrial practitioners. The top 100 headings, abstracts and key words (i.e. a total of 619 publications of any kind) for each search term were independently analyzed in order to ensure the reliability of the review process. Note that, this exhaustive literature review provides a concrete definition of Industry 4.0 and defines its six design principles such as interoperability, virtualization, local, real-time talent, service orientation and modularity.

As data centers continue to grow in size and complexity, it is desirable to understand aspects of their design that are worthy of carrying forward, as well as existing or upcoming shortcomings and challenges that would have to be addressed. We envision the data center evolving from owned physical entities to potentially outsourced, virtualized and geographically distributed infrastructures that still attempt to provide the same level of control and isolation that owned infrastructures do. We define a layered model for such data centers and provide a detailed treatment of state of the art and emerging challenges in storage, networking, management and power/thermal aspects. © 2009.},

   abstract = {This study proposes a new model of firewall called the 'Tree-Rule Firewall', which offers various benefits and is applicable for large networks such as 'cloud' networks. The recently available firewalls (i.e., Listed-Rule firewalls) have their limitations in performing the tasks and are inapplicable for working on some networks with huge firewall rule sizes. The Listed-Rule firewall is mathematically tested in this paper to prove that the firewall potentially causes conflict rules and redundant rules and hence leads to problematic network security systems and slow functional speed. To overcome these problems, we show the design and development of Tree-Rule firewall that does not create conflict rules and redundant rules. In a Tree-Rule firewall, the rule positioning is based on a tree structure instead of traditional rule listing. To manage firewall rules, we implement a Tree-Rule firewall on the Linux platform and test it on a regular network and under a cloud environment respectively to show its performance. It is demonstrated that the Tree-Rule firewall offers better network security and functional speed than the Listed-Rule firewall. Compared to the Listed-Rule firewall, rules of the Tree-Rule firewall are easier to be created, especially on a large network such as a cloud network. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The salient features of cloud computing (such as on-demand self-service, resource pooling, broad network access, rapid elasticity, and measured service) are being exploited by attackers to launch the severe Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. Generally, the DDoS attacks in such an environment have been implemented by flooding a huge volume (high-rate) of malicious traffic to exhaust the victim servers' resources. Due to this huge volume of malicious traffic, such attacks can be easily detected. Thus, attackers are getting attracted towards the low-rate DDoS attacks, slowly. Low-rate DDoS attacks are difficult to detect due to their stealthy and low-rate traffic. In the recent years, many efforts have been devoted to defend against the low-rate DDoS attacks. By utilizing the salient features of cloud computing, it becomes easy for an attacker to launch sophisticated low-rate DDoS attacks. Thus, the study of various DDoS attacks and their corresponding defense approaches becomes essential to protect the cloud infrastructure from fatal effects of DDoS attacks. This paper presents a comprehensive taxonomy of all the possible variants of cloud DDoS attacks solutions with detailed insight into the characterization, prevention, detection, and mitigation mechanisms. The paper provides a detailed discussion on essential performance metrics to evaluate various defense solutions and their behavior in a cloud environment. The purpose of this survey paper is to excite the cloud security researchers to develop effective defense solutions against the various DDoS attacks. The research gaps and challenges are found, and described in the paper while future research directions are outlined.},

In the last decade, cloud services have inevitably entangled with businesses’ and individuals’ daily lives through products and services. On-demand, pay-per-use characteristics encourage corporations to outsource part of their businesses to accelerate their services and multiply value. The latest market tendency toward migration to cloud environments, started in 2019, indicates a flourishing trend in the next few years. Despite the numerous benefits of the cloud computing model for businesses or individuals, security issues still have been stated as the top cloud challenge in 2020. Although various factors affect security, technologies enabling cloud computing such as virtualization and multitenancy, in addition to on-demand characteristics, initiate new security entrances for malevolent activities. In this study, we surveyed service-based cloud computing security issues to establish the current state of the field.

   abstract = {Despite the soaring use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in mobile applications, uniformly sustaining high-performance inference on mobile has been elusive due to the excessive computational demands of modern CNNs and the increasing diversity of deployed devices. A popular alternative comprises offloading CNN processing to powerful cloud-based servers. Nevertheless, by relying on the cloud to produce outputs, emerging mission-critical and high-mobility applications, such as drone obstacle avoidance or interactive applications, can suffer from the dynamic connectivity conditions and the uncertain availability of the cloud. In this paper, we propose SPINN, a distributed inference system that employs synergistic device-cloud computation together with a progressive inference method to deliver fast and robust CNN inference across diverse settings. The proposed system introduces a novel scheduler that co-optimises the early-exit policy and the CNN splitting at run time, in order to adapt to dynamic conditions and meet user-defined service-level requirements. Quantitative evaluation illustrates that SPINN outperforms its state-of-the-art collaborative inference counterparts by up to 2× in achieved throughput under varying network conditions, reduces the server cost by up to 6.8× and improves accuracy by 20.7% under latency constraints, while providing robust operation under uncertain connectivity conditions and significant energy savings compared to cloud-centric execution.},

However, the services provided by third-party cloud service providers entail additional security threats. The migration of user's assets (data, applications, etc.) outside the administrative control in a shared environment where numerous users are collocated escalates the security concerns.

   abstract = {Cloud computing adoption and diffusion are threatened by unresolved security issues that affect both the cloud provider and the cloud user. In this paper, we show how virtualization can increase the security of cloud computing, by protecting both the integrity of guest virtual machines and the cloud infrastructure components. In particular, we propose a novel architecture, Advanced Cloud Protection System (ACPS), aimed at guaranteeing increased security to cloud resources. ACPS can be deployed on several cloud solutions and can effectively monitor the integrity of guest and infrastructure components while remaining fully transparent to virtual machines and to cloud users. ACPS can locally react to security breaches as well as notify a further security management layer of such events. A prototype of our ACPS proposal is fully implemented on two current open source solutions: Eucalyptus and OpenECP. The prototype is tested against effectiveness and performance. In particular: (a) effectiveness is shown testing our prototype against attacks known in the literature; (b) performance evaluation of the ACPS prototype is carried out under different types of workload. Results show that our proposal is resilient against attacks and that the introduced overhead is small when compared to the provided features. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Cloud computing has changed the using, storing, and sharing of resources such as data, services, and applications for industrial applications. During the last decade, industries have rapidly switched to cloud computing for having more comprehensive access, reduced cost, and increased performance. In addition, significant improvement has been observed in the internet of things (IoT) with the integration of cloud computing. However, this rapid transition into the cloud raised various security issues and concerns. Traditional security solutions are not directly applicable and sometimes ineffective for cloud-based systems. Cloud platforms’ challenges and security concerns have been addressed during the last three years, despite the successive use and proliferation of multifaceted cyber weapons. The rapid evolution of deep learning (DL) in the artificial intelligence (AI) domain has brought many benefits that can be utilized to address industrial security issues in the cloud. The findings of the proposed research include the following: we present a comprehensive survey of enabling cloud-based IoT architecture, services, configurations, and security models; the classification of cloud security concerns in IoT into four major categories (data, network and service, applications, and people-related security issues), which are discussed in detail; we identify and inspect the latest advancements in cloud-based IoT attacks; we identify, discuss, and analyze significant security issues in each category and present the limitations from a general, artificial intelligence and deep learning perspective; we provide the technological challenges identified in the literature and then identify significant research gaps in the IoT-based cloud infrastructure to highlight future research directions to blend cybersecurity in cloud.},

   abstract = {'Deepfakes' are computationally created entities that falsely represent reality. They can take image, video, and audio modalities, and pose a threat to many areas of systems and societies, comprising a topic of interest to various aspects of cybersecurity and cybersafety. In 2020, a workshop consulting AI experts from academia, policing, government, the private sector, and state security agencies rank ed deepfak es as the most serious AI threat. These experts noted that since fake material can propagate through many uncontrolled routes, changes in citizen behaviour may be the only effective defence. This study aims to assess human ability to identify image deepfakes of human faces (these being uncurated output from the StyleGAN2 algorithm as trained on the FFHQ dataset) from a pool of non-deepfake images (these being random selection of images from the FFHQ dataset), and to assess the effectiveness of some simple interventions intended to improve detection accuracy. Using an online survey, participants (N = 280) were randomly allocated to one of four groups: a control group, and three assistance interventions. Each participant was shown a sequence of 20 images randomly selected from a pool of 50 deepfake images of human faces and 50 images of real human faces. Participants were asked whether each image was AI-generated or not, to report their confidence, and to describe the reasoning behind each response. Overall detection accuracy was only just above chance and none of the interventions significantly improved this. Of equal concern was the fact that participants' confidence in their answers was high and unrelated to accuracy. Assessing the results on a per-image basis reveals that participants consistently found certain images easy to label correctly and certain images difficult, but reported similarly high confidence regardless of the image. Thus, although participant accuracy was 62% overall, this accuracy across images ranged quite evenly between 85 and 30%, with an accuracy of below 50% for one in every five images. We interpret the findings as suggesting that there is a need for an urgent call to action to address this threat.},

The tokenization and weighting feature methods are used to filter the noisy data and further, to zoom the importance of each token in terms of source code plagiarism. Then, the deep learning approach is used to detect source code plagiarism. The dataset is collected from Google Code Jam (GCJ) to investigate software piracy. Apart from this, the deep convolutional neural network is used to detect malicious infections in IoT network through color image visualization. The malware samples are obtained from Maling dataset for experimentation.
